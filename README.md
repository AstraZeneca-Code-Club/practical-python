# Practical Python

_Session material and solutions for the Practical Python course at AZ Macclesfield_

## Using This Repository

Each session is contained in its own folder and includes the Powerpoint presentation given in the session, solutions for the session execises in a Jupyter notebook, and a model solution for the session project as a Python script. 

The project solution is intended to be a model solution containing full documentation and testing. It is not expected for you to add such additional components to your solution but rather you should focus on the essential parts. A full solution is only provided as indication of the direction we want to be heading in and to build up experience with looking at source code.
